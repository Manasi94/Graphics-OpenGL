##Tree Drawing Algorithm
This is the implementation of the paper ["Tidy Drawing of Tree"](https://github.com/Manasi94/Graphics-OpenGL/blob/master/Tree%20Drawing%20Algo/10.1.1.150.4061.pdf) by Charles Wetherrell and Alfred Shannon.
The paper has suggested three different algorithms for drawing tree data structure taking into consideration the aesthetics and contraints involved while drawing this tree.
The three algorithms discussed are implemented in C++ using OpenGL namely ["Algo1 (binary tree drawer)"](http://manasi94.github.io/Graphics-OpenGL/Algo1.html), ["Algo2 (naive tree drawer)"](http://manasi94.github.io/Graphics-OpenGL/Algo2.html) and ["Algo3 (tidy tree drawer)"](http://manasi94.github.io/Graphics-OpenGL/Algo3.html).

##Code
Open your terminal and go to the file location and type the following command: 
```terminal
g++ Algo3.cpp -o algo3 -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU
```

The executable file is already present in this repository.
